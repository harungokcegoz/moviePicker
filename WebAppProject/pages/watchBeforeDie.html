                Who'd have thought a story by Stephen King, more over a short
                story, would do so well both commercially and critically? Well,
                this is what you get when you get Frank Darabont to direct a
                movie with Morgan Freeman in it.

                Biased here. Not everybody loves this movie, but it's on the top of my watch list purely because of the rawness and emotion of the scenes with long strips of conversation. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's screenwriting debut, which they co-won an Oscar for. If only Titanic did not completely eclipse this movie in 1997, this movie would have
                won much more than the 4 academy awards than it did.

                Ok, many people would find this movie weird, because of its weird chronological sequence and generally random themes and events that don't really connect or have significance as a whole. Well that's the point here. Narrowing down on scenes and having long, conversational scenes where gangsters discuss philosophical ideas isn't what you'd usually expect of them. Not to mention Samuel Jackson's Oscar-Worthy acting. Tarantino's best.

                Kevin Spacey's voice is probably my most favorite voice in the world. He has just the right tinge of timbre in a background of this alto voice that is exceptionally soothing. The theme of this movie is not what you'd expect it to be, and the turning point appears gradually, ending off in an ultimate climax with, again, Spacey's voice as the backdrop of the finale.

                I had nightmares for 3 days after watching this. Don't use that as an excuse not to watch it though. It's excellent, really.

                I watched this again recently and I realised what I wrote above doesn't do much justice to the movie. The scenes are beautiful; the way the memories were removed were extremely well thought out, the slow fading of the details from the backgrounds were the little facts I loved about the movie. I should probably move this up to my top 5. Yes, I should.

                Officially the most disturbing movie I've ever watched. This would not have been without the excellent cinematography and lightings. Although you'd think a movie discouraging the use of drugs by showing its terrible effects would deter the individual, it made me want to try them even more. JK, heh.
